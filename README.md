# Thesis-Analysis-Scripts

Analysis scripts for EEG and MEG sensor-space analyses, including:
- FOOOF spectral parametrisation
- TFR (time-frequency representations)
- ERP (event-related potentials)
- Behavioural and LMM analyses in R

This repository contains only analysis code (no data).  
Detailed instructions for reproducing the EEG analysis pipeline are provided in the main README once scripts are added.
